They might want me to generate code for the app or actually run it. Given there are options like an index.html string or a TypeScript server, I think option 1—providing a self-contained index.html—is the simplest approach. I'll need to keep the UI interactive, so I'll focus on that.\n",

The code execution tool supports multiple languages, and while not strictly necessary, it could help ensure I comply with the instructions. I can run a Node script to test the game logic functions structured as JS functions. The final output still needs to be the index.html string, and I'll run necessary tests for win detection using the code execution tool. Let's keep this structured!\n",

The `checkWinner` function will return either 'X', 'O', or null, and it should also detect a draw. I’ll implement a 3x3 grid using CSS, with clickable cells displaying the current player or winner status. When a cell is clicked, I need to ensure that the game isn't over and the cell is empty before proceeding. After a human move, the AI will randomly select a valid empty cell to make its move, and I'll include a small delay for better user experience. I must also block invalid moves during the AI's turn.\n",

The requirement is clear: after each human move, the AI, always 'O', will make a valid random move, but it shouldn't make a move if the game has ended or the board is full. For the current player display, I can show \"Current player: X/O\" instead of more detailed info. I'll also make sure to block invalid moves and visually indicate when a move is ignored. Finally, after the game is over, I'll disable pointer events on the cells.\n",
